		"choices": [
			"free nerve endings",
			"hair cells",
			"modified connective tissue cells",
			"modified epithelial cells"
		],
		"answer": 3,
		"explanation": "Taste receptors are specialized epithelial cells that synapse with sensory neurons."

		"choices": [
			"Sweet",
			"Salty",
			"Pungent",
			"Sour"
		],
		"answer": 2,
		"explanation": "The primary tastes are sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami; pungent is not one of them."

	{
		"prompt": "Where are the receptors for hearing located?",
		"choices": [
			"In the ampullae",
			"In the spiral organ",
			"In the utricles",
			"In the saccules"
		],
		"answer": 1,
		"explanation": "The spiral organ (organ of Corti) in the cochlea contains the sensory cells for hearing."

		"prompt": "What is the treatment for a cataract?",
		"choices": [
			"Removal of the cornea",
			"Anchoring the retina in place",
			"Removal of the lens",
			"Using medication to reduce production of aqueous humor"
		],
		"answer": 2,
		"explanation": "A cataract is clouding of the lens, and treatment usually involves surgical lens removal and replacement."
