		"prompt": "What comprises the central nervous system (CNS)?",
		"choices": [
			"Spinal and cranial nerves",
			"Brain and spinal cord",
			"Brain and cranial nerves",
			"Nerves in the upper and lower limbs"
		],
		"answer": 1,
		"explanation": "The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord; peripheral nerves make up the PNS."
	},
	{
		"prompt": "What is contained within the epidural space in the vertebral column?",
		"choices": [
			"Loose connective tissue, blood vessels, and adipose tissue",
			"Dense connective tissue and cartilage",
			"Serous fluid",
			"Collagen, elastin, and bone tissue"
		],
		"answer": 0,
		"explanation": "The epidural space contains fat, loose connective tissue, and blood vessels cushioning the spinal cord."
	},
	{
		"prompt": "The __________ is the thin meninx attached to the surface of the brain, containing many nerves and blood vessels.",
		"choices": [
			"dura mater",
			"arachnoid mater",
			"pia mater",
			"subdural mater"
		],
		"answer": 2,
		"explanation": "The pia mater closely follows the contours of the brain and is rich in blood vessels."
	},
	{
		"prompt": "What is the correct order for the components of a reflex arc?",
		"choices": [
			"Receptor, sensory neuron, motor neuron, interneuron, effector",
			"Effector, receptor, sensory neuron, motor neuron, interneuron",
			"Effector, sensory neuron, receptor, interneuron, motor neuron",
			"Receptor, sensory neuron, interneuron, motor neuron, effector"
		],
		"answer": 3,
		"explanation": "A typical reflex arc follows this path: receptor → sensory neuron → interneuron → motor neuron → effector."
	},
	{
		"prompt": "What is the cauda equina?",
		"choices": [
			"Outermost protective layer covering the brain and spinal cord",
			"The inferior tip of the spinal cord",
			"Bundle of nervous tissue that extends beyond tip of spinal cord",
			"Cord of connective tissue that anchors spinal cord to the coccyx"
		],
		"answer": 2,
		"explanation": "The cauda equina is a bundle of spinal nerve roots extending below the end of the spinal cord."
	},
	{
		"prompt": "In the spinal cord, __________ matter is surrounded by __________ matter.",
		"choices": [
			"white; gray",
			"gray; white"
		],
		"answer": 1,
		"explanation": "In cross-section, the spinal cord has an inner H-shaped region of gray matter surrounded by white matter."
	},
	{
		"prompt": "What would be the effect of damage to Broca's area?",
		"choices": [
			"Memory loss",
			"Impaired motor control of the left side of the body",
			"Vision loss",
			"Loss of motor control needed for speech"
		],
		"answer": 3,
		"explanation": "Broca’s area coordinates the motor actions for speech; damage causes difficulty producing spoken words."
	},
	{
		"prompt": "What is a function of the association areas of the frontal lobes?",
		"choices": [
			"Stimulate movement of arms and legs",
			"Higher intellectual processes, including planning and problem solving",
			"Analysis and interpretation of auditory input",
			"Analysis and interpretation of visual input"
		],
		"answer": 1,
		"explanation": "Frontal association areas are involved in higher cognitive functions such as planning and decision making."
	},
	{
		"prompt": "What is a cerebrovascular accident?",
		"choices": [
			"Accumulation of blood between meningeal layers",
			"Abnormal brain wave activity",
			"Death of nervous system tissue due to blocked blood flow",
			"Death of brain tissue due to increased intracranial pressure"
		],
		"answer": 2,
		"explanation": "A cerebrovascular accident (stroke) results from interrupted blood flow, causing tissue death in the brain."
	},
	{
		"prompt": "For most people, the dominant cerebral hemisphere is their __________ hemisphere.",
		"choices": [
			"left",
			"right"
		],
		"answer": 0,
		"explanation": "In most individuals, the left hemisphere is dominant, especially for language and analytic tasks."
	},
	{
		"prompt": "Functionally, the adrenal medulla has the same effects on the body as the __________ nervous system.",
		"choices": [
			"sympathetic",
			"somatic",
			"parasympathetic",
			"sensory"
		],
		"answer": 0,
		"explanation": "The adrenal medulla releases epinephrine and norepinephrine, mimicking sympathetic nervous system activity."
